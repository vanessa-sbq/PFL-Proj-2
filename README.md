## Game Description
Mabula is a two-player strategy game played on a grid. Initially, 12 Marbles are placed randomly on the perimeter of the grid and there cannot be more than two marbles of the same color in a row, even around a corner. Marbles are then pushed each turn, until there are no more marbles on the perimeter. The player with the largest connected group of marbles wins.
